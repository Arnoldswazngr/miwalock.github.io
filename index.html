  Common Issue : Locks not working due to Daylight savings .
  <br>
  </br>
  Solution: On the Front Desk PC, open the Miwa Software, select the Management tab and issue a daylight savings card.
Run the card by a few locks and test guest cards on the doors afterwards. If it works, run the daylight savings card by the entire property.
